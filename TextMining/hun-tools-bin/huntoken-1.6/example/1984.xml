<s FROM=Oen.1.1.30.11>A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic.

<s FROM=Oen.1.1.30.12>And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.

<s FROM=Oen.1.1.30.13>Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies.

<s FROM=Oen.1.1.30.15>At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization.

<s FROM=Oen.1.1.31.8>He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.

<s FROM=Oen.1.1.32.1>The Hate rose to its climax.

<s FROM=Oen.1.1.32.4>But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired, blackmoustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen.

<s FROM=Oen.4.6.6>Its place was taken by think, which did duty for both noun and verb.

<s FROM=Oen.4.6.7>No etymological principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb.

<s FROM=Oen.4.6.8>Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently suppressed. 
</s>
<s FROM=Oen.4.6.9>There was, for example, no such word as cut, its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb knife.

<s FROM=Oen.4.6.10>Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix &ndash; ful to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding &ndash; wise.

<s FROM=Oen.4.6.11>Thus for example, speedful meant rapid and speedwise meant quickly.

<s FROM=Oen.4.6.12>Certain of our present-day adjectives, such as good, strong, big, black, soft, were retained, but their total number was very small.
